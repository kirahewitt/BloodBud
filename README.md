# BloodBud Hackathon Project
By donating blood, you can bring the “gift of life” to someone in need. Now more than ever, it is essential that people continue to donate blood to prevent medical shortages during this global pandemic. We’ve made this process easier than ever, with an Apple Watch app that keeps track of yearly visits, vibrates every five seconds as a reminder to squeeze and increase blood circulation, and finally turns on a 15 minute timer to ensure users wait a sufficient amount of time before resuming to normal activities. 

When the app is first launched, users are taken to the main screen where they are able to start a new blood donation (Img 1). After clicking “start”, a 15 minute countdown begins and every five seconds the watch vibrates to remind users to squeeze their fist to increase blood circulation. After 15 minutes, or whenever approximately one pint of blood is drawn and the user clicks “finished”, they are taken to the next screen. Another 15 minute timer starts to ensure users relax and don’t experience any side effects from the blood loss. When the 15 minutes is up or users feel sufficiently rested, a popup thank-you screen appears and congratulates users on their good act. Finally, users are taken to a list of their previous donations, and are shown when they are eligible to donate again. This screen can be reached at any time by swiping left.
